# Interplay 🎹

🚧 **Work in Progress**

Interplay is a conversational MIDI sequencer for live music creation and improvisation. Built for the Waldorf Robot Mono Synthesizer, it uses pattern-based looping and natural language control to make exploring musical ideas intuitive and immediate.

## What is Interplay?

Interplay lets you create and modify musical patterns through simple commands and (eventually) natural conversation. Patterns loop continuously, with changes queued and applied at loop boundaries—giving you real-time control without worrying about timing.

**Current Status:** Phase 1 - Basic pattern loop with MIDI playback working

## Quick Start

```bash
go build
./interplay
```
