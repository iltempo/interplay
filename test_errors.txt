# Error handling test - demonstrates graceful error continuation
# Usage: ./interplay --script test_errors.txt
#        OR: cat test_errors.txt | ./interplay

# This script intentionally contains errors to test error handling

# Valid command
set 1 C3

# ERROR: Invalid step number (should log error and continue)
set 999 D3

# Valid command - should still execute
set 5 G3

# ERROR: Invalid note (should log error and continue)
set 9 X99

# Valid command - should still execute
set 13 C4

# Valid command
tempo 100

# Show what actually got set (only valid commands)
show

# Don't save (contains errors)
# Don't exit - continue playing the partial pattern

# Expected behavior:
# - Errors are logged to stderr
# - Valid commands execute successfully
# - Pattern plays with only the valid notes set
# - Script continues playing (no exit command)
